The system is capable of calculationg properties of various flat bar system.

With this project I tried to wrap my head around WPF and MVVM architecture. Despite many drawbacks I learned a lot from it. 

Project was built using following technologies:
- **.NET Core**
- **WPF**
- **Newtonsoft.Json** as a serializer
- **Math.Net Numerics** for some matrix and vector calculations
- **OxyPlot** to visualise calculated data
